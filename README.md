# OldSurvivors-BETA
A mod created by me that aims to bring back all old survivor models &amp; their cosmetics 1:1 from old DBD, with 1:1 reverted physics.

**Currently supported survivors:**

- Dwight
- Meg [NOT WORKING, will release in future patch].
- Claudette
- Jake
- Nea [ + old Nea Bob Wig - recreated by [Oleg]([url](https://github.com/olshab))ðŸ˜‰
- Quentin

All characters above currently have old prestige + old legacy outfits.
Currently they are **custom slots**, but in the future they will be changed to replace existing slots so other people will see them.

**Changes/Fixes from my old version of this mod:**

- Legacy is now exactly 1:1 as 3.0.0 - 4.4.2, there is no differences at all.
- Fixed characters being too shiny and completely disabled some values to further match 3.0.0
- Hair positions are now 1:1, thanks to being attached to Hair Sockets.
- Glasses/ACC positions are now 1:1, thanks to socket attachments.

**NOTES:**

While my goal is to return 1:1 physics for the old cosmetics, currently they are not working, so no ETA. <br>
This mod will be continuously worked on over time with new characters/cosmetics being added. <br>
In the future a new custom hair material will be used, which greatly improves quality of the hair (you can already see this with Nea Bob Wig hair ðŸ˜‰).

**Credits:**

**Oleg - for his amazing project which makes creating old survivors so much easier.**
